# Overview

This app is part of the SwiftUI tutorial provided by Apple. This app creates pages for landmarks,
displaying their location and some basic information about them.

My purpose for creating this app was to learn about SwiftUI and how to use it. I am looking forward to using SwiftUI in order to create
other applications in the future.

# Development Environment

I used Xcode as my IDE to develop this project. 

The programming language that I used was the Swift language created by Apple. I was also pulling from the
SwiftUI library, as well as MapKit library, both of which are also provided by Apple. These libraries allowed me to create
an interactive interface displaying a map and information about a given landmark.
